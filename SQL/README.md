A school project to practice python and SQL database management through a textual user interface (TTUI) using postreSQL

This program is meant to emulate a TTUI for managing campaigns events, stages, budget, and employees. The TTUI can run stored queries, populate a database.

Unfortunately, the code cannot be run as it connected to a postgrSQL server owned by UVIC which is no longer accessible. The code for accessing said server has been removed as it contained sensitive data.
