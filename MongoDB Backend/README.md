A school project in software architecture.

This project used NodeJS, Typescript, and mongoDB to create a backend for a mock application to manage projects and their respective use cases. Users only had access to projects they had created or had been added to by the owner. Projects, users, and use cases could all be added, edited, and deleted using the API. Endpoints were defined in the server.ts file where they were then called in their respective managers in a modular style of architecture.

Was developed in tandem with another studentâ€™s front end which I do not have the rights to, nor access to. Therefor to see the code run one must use a third-party application such as Postman to interact with application endpoints.
