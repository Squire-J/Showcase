This is a personal project for developing a story management system with a focus on Dungeons and Dragons. Progress will be updated interminably time-permitting. 
Long term goals include character/ settlement generation, battle simulations,  and advanced file management UI designed to aid in storyboarding and running a game on the fly.

Current Projects
Monster Card creation:
	Scrubbing data from an XML file and creating “cards” to hold monster stats, abilities, ect. These cards will then be used to populate a database.
    Run using terminal command in the scripts folder $python GenMonsterCards.py
